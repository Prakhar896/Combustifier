# Combustifier

Put succinctly, Combustifier is a multi-platform application designed for users in HDB (Housing Development Board) blocks to easily identify combustible items in their corridors and report instances of corridors blocked by inconsiderate neighbours' property.

I was the Team Manager as well as the iOS Developer of The Combustifier Team (that includes [@yisiansim](https://toasterclock.github.io), [@vedkalanke](https://github.com/rreserVED) and [@benjaminraharjo](https://github.com/benjaminthree)). The project consists of many components that work together in synchrony to give you accurate results in real-time.
